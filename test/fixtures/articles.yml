# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: {title: "Title", body: "Body", author_name: "Author"}
# column: value
#
two: {title: "The One And Only", body: "I am the one and only", author_name: "One and Only"}
#  column: value
